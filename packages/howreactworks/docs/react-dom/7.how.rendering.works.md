# How Rendering works

In the previous section (`how begin work works`), we left a big unexplained
switch statement. The goal now is to explore it.

Let's put back the switch [before starting:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L4098)


```tsx
// simplified
function beginWork(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  
  // previous code
  
  switch(workInProgress.tag) {
    // case FunctionComponent:
    // case ClassComponent:
    // case IndeterminateComponent:
    // case HostRoot:
    // case HostPortal:
    // case HostComponent:
    // case HostText:
    // case Fragment:
    // case Mode:
    // case ContextConsumer:
    // case ContextProvider:
    // case ForwardRef:
    // case Profiler:
    // case SuspenseComponent:
    // case MemoComponent:
    // case SimpleMemoComponent:
    // case LazyComponent:
    // case IncompleteClassComponent:
    // case DehydratedFragment:
    // case SuspenseListComponent:
    // case ScopeComponent:
    // case OffscreenComponent:
    // case LegacyHiddenComponent:
    // case CacheComponent:
    // case TracingMarkerComponent:
    // case HostHoistable:
    // case HostSingleton:
  }

  throw new Error('...');
}
```

:::note
This section would assume a very important thing, we will explain how each work
tag is rendered, but it is very important to know that, during the reconcile
children step of render, the next child's alternate is created, which will
be the `workInProgress`.

On the first mount, the `workInProgerss` being the alternate and `current` being
`null` at this point. But later on updates, `current` is defined.

So if you are wondering but when the first fiber was created ? the previous
section ended with a note mentioning the creation of the third fiber
when coming from `root.render()` which will be the `alternate` of the very first
child given that `render` received.
:::

## How rendering by WorkTag works
`beginWork` will redirect to the function that's specialized in rendering
by the fiber's `tag`.

### How rendering Function Component works

We will start by the most common way to create components: `function components`.

```tsx
switch(workInProgress.tag) {
  case FunctionComponent: {
    // 1 Component is your function component
    //   workInProgress is the alternate of this tree
    //   current === null means: this component is mounting for the first time
    const Component = workInProgress.type;
    // 2 pendingProps are the next props that the component will render with
    const unresolvedProps = workInProgress.pendingProps;
    // 3 resolveDefaultProps will happen when Component changed type
    const resolvedProps =
      workInProgress.elementType === Component
        ? unresolvedProps
        : resolveDefaultProps(Component, unresolvedProps);
    // 4 render the component
    return updateFunctionComponent(
      current, // Fiber | null: the current rendered fiber
      workInProgress, // its alternate (at first, it is created before current)
      Component, // the function component
      resolvedProps, // component props
      renderLanes, // the render lanes
    );
  }
}
```

So this is how your function components gets rendered. Let's break the top
level code before entering into [`updateFunctionComponent`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L1092)

1. The first step consists of referencing the `workInProgress` fiber `type`.
2. The `pendingProps` are called `unresolvedProps` because we may need to add
   the defaultProps to them next.
3. In case the `workInProgress.elementType` is different from `workInProgress.type`
   then we will resolve the default props from the `workInProgress.type`.
4. return the real rendering work via `updateFunctionComponent`

:::note
The first mount of function components doesn't pass through the `FunctionComponent`
case, but rather through the `IndeterminateComponent`.

Because initially when React creates a `Fiber` from `Element` it marks it as
[`IndeterminateComponent`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js#L501)
and when attempting to render it, it will mark it as `FunctionComponent` as we
will see in the case related to this.
:::

So `updateFunctionComponent` is the function that will re-render our function
components, let's see what it [looks like:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L1092)

```tsx
// simplified
function updateFunctionComponent(
  current: null | Fiber, // current rendered fiber
  workInProgress: Fiber, // alternate (wip)
  Component: any, // the function Component
  nextProps: any, // the new props
  renderLanes: Lanes, // the render lanes (DefaultLane, SyncLane, Transition...)
): Fiber | null {
  // [...] some legacy context management

  // 1
  // prepare to read context inside this component
  prepareToReadContext(workInProgress, renderLanes);

  // 2
  // You were probably waiting to see this function from the beginning ðŸ˜…
  // Note: rendering function components from Indeterminate will call this
  // function too.
  // highlight-next-line
  let nextChildren = renderWithHooks(
    current,
    workInProgress,
    Component,
    nextProps,
    // you can ignore this.
    // you insist ? it is the second arg to your function component ðŸ™‚
    context,
    renderLanes,
  );
  
  if (current !== null && !didReceiveUpdate) {
    // highlight-next-line
    bailoutHooks(current, workInProgress, renderLanes);
    // highlight-next-line
    return bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork(current, workInProgress, renderLanes);
  }

  workInProgress.flags |= PerformedWork;
  // 3
  // We've seen this before ðŸ˜‰ and we will see it again and again and again
  // highlight-next-line
  reconcileChildren(current, workInProgress, nextChildren, renderLanes);
  return workInProgress.child;
}
```

The major steps for rendering a function component as seen above are:

#### Prepare to read context
When rendering a function component, you may use the `useContext` hook to
subscribe to the nearest `ReactContext`.

The calls to `useContext` will actually register the desired context in the
`fiber.dependencies` linked list.

Before rendering, [React will](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/540bab085d571789f4562565eebfd0db9f36345c/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberNewContext.js#L686)
[empty this list](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/540bab085d571789f4562565eebfd0db9f36345c/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberNewContext.js#L707)
in the alternate and during render it will stack them again
(React won't care if you change which context you
[subscribe to.](https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-fire-klzj6c?file=/src/App.js:169-185)).

#### render with hooks

Let's put you into context with its signature and how we called it first:

```tsx
export function renderWithHooks<Props, SecondArg>(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  Component: (p: Props, arg: SecondArg) => any,
  props: Props,
  secondArg: SecondArg,
  nextRenderLanes: Lanes,
): any {
  // [Not Native Code]
}


// we called it like this
let nextChildren = renderWithHooks(
  current,
  workInProgress,
  Component,
  nextProps,
  context,
  renderLanes,
);
```

Let's scratch [its implementation:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d6dcad6a8beaeec0513a9851d1e0fe1181932360/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L494)

```tsx

// simplified
export function renderWithHooks<Props, SecondArg>(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  Component: (p: Props, arg: SecondArg) => any,
  props: Props,
  secondArg: SecondArg,
  nextRenderLanes: Lanes,
): any {
  // two module internal states 
  renderLanes = nextRenderLanes;
  currentlyRenderingFiber = workInProgress;
  
  
  // reset some workInProgress properties (this is an alternate)
  workInProgress.memoizedState = null;
  workInProgress.updateQueue = null;
  workInProgress.lanes = NoLanes;

  // 1
  // This step is so important in react hooks
  // highlight-next-line
  ReactCurrentDispatcher.current =
    // this means that the component is mounting for the first time
    current === null || current.memoizedState === null
      ? HooksDispatcherOnMount
      : HooksDispatcherOnUpdate;
  
  const shouldDoubleRenderInDev = __DEV__ && (workInProgress.mode & StrictMode);

  // 2
  // highlight-next-line
  let children = Component(props, secondArg);
  
  // 3
  if (didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass) {
    // highlight-next-line
    children = renderWithHooksAgain(
      workInProgress,
      Component,
      props,
      secondArg,
    );
  }
  
  // 4
  if (shouldDoubleRenderInDev) {
    // highlight-next-line
    children = renderWithHooksAgain(
      workInProgress,
      Component,
      props,
      secondArg,
    );
  }

  // 5
  finishRenderingHooks(current, workInProgress, Component);

  // 6
  return children;
}

```

Let's explain and dive into the major steps above:

1. The first thing to do when rendering a function component is to set 
   the right dispatcher:
   1. When the component is mounting for the first time, then [`HooksDispatcherOnMount`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d6dcad6a8beaeec0513a9851d1e0fe1181932360/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3357)
      is used.
   2. When the component is updating, then [`HooksDispatcherOnUpdate`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d6dcad6a8beaeec0513a9851d1e0fe1181932360/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3395)
      is used.
   These dispatchers are explained in details in the hooks section.
   
   The information you would need about the dispatcher in this section is that
   all exported hooks will start by resolving what's the current dispatcher
   (the one React set before rendering your component) then return the same
   function from the dispatcher.
   ```tsx
   // almost all the hooks do this pattern
   function useSomeHook() {
     const dispatcher = ReactCurrentDispatcher.current;
     return dispatcher.useSomeHook();
   }
   ```
   
2. The second step is rendering the actual component and taking its return:
   ```tsx
   let children = Component(props, secondArg);
   ```
   The second arg is the `context` (or `pendingContext`) property from the
   `fiberRoot` of this tree.
   :::note
   By here, all your hooks got executed.
   :::
3. React will keep track of whether the current rendering component did schedule
   a **render phase update**, and if it is the case, it will `render again`:

   [`renderWithHooksAgain` is a function](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d6dcad6a8beaeec0513a9851d1e0fe1181932360/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L765)
   that ticks if a function component did schedule a render phase update or when
   replaying the render of a component in dev due to `StrictMode`.

   The goal of render again is to keep track of nested updates and infinite loops,
   and also it will set a different dispatcher that would change the behavior
   of some hooks (more on this in hooks section).

   ```tsx
   function renderWithHooksAgain<Props, SecondArg>(
     workInProgress: Fiber,
     Component: (p: Props, arg: SecondArg) => any,
     props: Props,
     secondArg: SecondArg,
   ): any {
     let numberOfRerenders = 0;
     let children;
     do {
       // some code related to thenables and use() hook
       didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass = false;
       
       if (numberOfReRenders >= RE_RENDER_LIMIT) {
         // highlight-next-line
         throw new Error(
           'Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent ' +
             'an infinite loop.',
         );
       }
       
       numberOfReRenders += 1;
       currentHook = null;
       workInProgressHook = null;
       workInProgress.updateQueue = null;
       
       
       // highlight-next-line
       ReactCurrentDispatcher.current = __DEV__
         ? HooksDispatcherOnRerenderInDEV
         : HooksDispatcherOnRerender;
       
       // highlight-next-line
       children = Component(props, secondArg);
     } while (didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdateDuringThisPass);
   
     return children;
   }
   ```
   
   renderWithHooksAgain will keep rendering your component until there it won't
   schedule a render phase update.

4. Similarly, when `StrictMode` is enabled, it will call `renderWithHooksAgain`
   again to perform another render.
5. Call [`finishRenderingHooks` function:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d6dcad6a8beaeec0513a9851d1e0fe1181932360/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L623)
   ```tsx
   finishRenderingHooks(current, workInProgress, Component);
   ```
   This function will:
   1. Reset the `ReactCurrentDispatcher` to `ContextOnlyDispatcher`
   2. Reset hooks variables (currentHook, wipHook)
   3. Reset some thenable and use states
   4. Throw when fewer hooks were used
6. The last step in `renderWithHooks` is to return the resulted `children`.
   ```tsx
   return children;
   ```


#### Reconcile children

After rendering the component and obtaining the next children, then it is
time to reconcile with the previous tree's children.

```tsx
let nextChildren = renderWithHooks(...);

reconcileChildren(current, workInProgress, nextChildren, renderLanes);

return workInProgress.child;
```

As seen previously, reconcile children will redirect the work to a reconciliation
function depending on whether the component is mounting or updating.

The goal of `reconcileChildren` is to create an `alternate` for the first child
which will be processed next.

In the case where this `child` fiber is null (we've reached the bottom of the
current tree), then if you remember from `performUnitOfWork`, it will call
`completeWork` when the `next` fiber to work on is `null`.

So, inside React, you just saw step by step how a function component gets
rendered.
