# How the work loop works

Before we dive into the work loop, let's see how it starts for the first time.

## How the concurrent work loop starts

For the concurrent `root`, the last thing we did is to schedule in
`scheduleTaskForRootDuringMicrotask` a callback to `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot`.

Let's break into the concurrent work on root.

```tsx
root.callbackNode = scheduleCallback(
  schedulerPriorityLevel,// NormalPriority for simple root.render
  performConcurrentWorkOnRoot.bind(null, root),
);
```

### `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot` signature

[`performConcurrentWorkOnRoot`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L841)
is defined as follows:

```tsx
export function performConcurrentWorkOnRoot(
  root: FiberRoot,
  didTimeout: boolean,
): RenderTaskFn | null { /* [Not Native Code] */ }
```

The `root` property was bound when scheduling the callback, and the `didTimeout`
will be passed when the scheduler will be executing [this callback.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/587ae49d71f218d34393291933d513d2975e22c3/packages/scheduler/src/forks/Scheduler.js#L234)

```tsx
// inside scheduler, simplified
const didTimeout = didCallbackTimedOut();
performConcurrentWorkOnBoundRoot(didTimeout);

// where
const performConcurrentWorkOnBoundRoot = performConcurrentWork.bind(null, root);
```

This function will be rendering your components and performing the whole logic,
so basically it will be insanely long, but we will move some parts from it
to their own sections (like `WorkTags`, `effects` types and their implementation
details, and obviously`hooks` too ).

### Implementation details
import TBD from "./components/TBDBanner"

1. Guard against calls to this function when already rendering or committing
   ```tsx
   if ((executionContext & (RenderContext | CommitContext)) !== NoContext) {
     throw new Error('Should not already be working.');
   }
   ```

2. Flush passive effects

   Effects will be fully discussed in their own section. It will be linked here
   once ready.
   
   ```tsx
   // simplified
   
   // this referencement here because flushPassiveEffects might schedule updates
   const originalCallbackNode = root.callbackNode;
   const didFlushPassiveEffects = flushPassiveEffects();
   
   if (didFlushPassiveEffects && root.callbackNode !== originalCallbackNode) {
     return null;
   }
   ```

   When passive effects are flushed and something did cancel the current
   scheduled callback, this function will stop execution and return `null`,
   because the other schedule would trigger its own work.
   
   From the `root.render()` perspective, we have no effects until now, so we
   will continue the execution. That's another reason to skip this section
   for now.

3. Compute again the `nextLanes`
   
   This is a leftover that should be fixed (until now), the next lanes
   are computed here again (we computed them first above in the
   `scheduleTaskForRootDuringMicrotask` function.)

   And obviously, if there are `NoLanes` (no work to do), then `null` is
   returned.

4. Determine if it should `time slice`

   To [use time slicing](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L888)
   , the root should not include [`BlockingLanes`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L475)
   or [`ExpiredLanes`.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L491)
   
   Blocking lanes are (per the previous link): `SyncDefaultLanes`,
   `InputContinuousHydrationLane`, `InputContinuousLane`, `DefaultHydrationLane`
   and `DefaultLane`.

   Yes, from `root.render()` without transition we are in `DefaultLane` so this
   render will be considered without time slicing, and thus a `Sync` one.

5. Call the real render function
   
   Depending on whether it should time slice, it will call `renderRootConcurrent`
   or else it will fall back to `renderRootSync`.

   ```tsx
   let exitStatus = shouldTimeSlice
     ? renderRootConcurrent(root, lanes)
     : renderRootSync(root, lanes);
   ```
6. Finish rendering and perform logic based on `exitStatus`

   The possible exitStatus values are [listed here.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L302)
   React will then either [mark the root as suspended](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L903)
   if the render did not complete, or else:
   1. Verify that the render is consistent [with external stores.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L915)
      If not, a sync render [will be performed](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L919)
      
      Then the `while(true)` loop `continue` until a good `exitStatus` is
      obtained.
   2. In case of `RootErrored` errors, React will attempt to
      [recover from them if possible.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L936)
      It will attempt to render again [using `renderRootSync`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L997).
   3. If the `exitStatus` is `RootFatalErrored`: TBD, this highlights probably
      a bug in React that prevented it from rendering.
   4. Or else, then the tree is consistent and the work is considered as finished
      ```tsx
      // simplified
      
      // React when rendering (we will see in the next section) will store
      // the render work output in a property called alternate in each fiber
      // we will see them in details in a few
      const finishedWork: Fiber = root.current.alternate;
      ```
      This variable is then affected to the finishedWork property of the `root`
      and then `finishConcurrentRender` is called.
      ```tsx
      root.finishedWork = finishedWork;
      root.finishedLanes = lanes;
      finishConcurrentRender(root, exitStatus, finishedWork, lanes);
      ```
      // todo: back to this once renderRoot is done

7. Ensure root is scheduled

   We already saw this in the how `root.render()` works section which will
   schedule again a micro task to attempt to render the root again, but mostly
   it won't find any work to do (it will know by only looking at the `nextLanes`,
   that's the power of lanes).

8. Return a continuation for the root
   <TBD />

   

## How `renderRootSync` works

So, we are finally there! The function that renders our components.

```tsx
function renderRootSync(root: FiberRoot, lanes: Lanes) {
  // [Not Native Code]
}
```

### 1. Mark render started
There is a global variable that WorkLoop module uses: `executionContext`, which
is a number used the same way Lanes are used. The possible values [are:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L297)

```tsx
export const NoContext = /*             */ 0b000;
const BatchedContext = /*               */ 0b001;
export const RenderContext = /*         */ 0b010;
export const CommitContext = /*         */ 0b100;
```

When the `render` starts, the `executionContext` is modified [as follows:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1838)

```tsx
const prevExecutionContext = executionContext;
executionContext |= RenderContext;

// later, after the render finishes:
executionContext = prevExecutionContext;
```

This variable is so important to React, it can know what kind of work it is
performing and guard against mis-usages.

### 2. Push the context only dispatcher

The React dispatcher is an object having several properties (such as hooks)
that is used by React to propagate behavior like in `dependency injection`
fashioned way.

At this point when the work loop is about to start, this is a transitory phase
and coming from the `root.render` path, a [`ContextOnlyDispatcher`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/ddff504695f33c19e8c0792bff82bd8f8b8f7c05/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3296)
is used which will allow only `readContext` and `use`.

The same is done to the upcoming `cache` feature of React, it will have its own
dispatcher.

The dispatchers will be more detailed in their own section.

### 3. Prepare a fresh stack
Next, `renderRoot` will have to check the currently processed root and its lanes
from the global variables against the root that it received from arguments
while scheduling.

You can [see it here.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1503)

```tsx
if (workInProgressRoot !== null || workInProgressRootRenderLanes !== lanes) {
   // some work
   prepareFreshStack(root, lanes);
}
```

Preparing a fresh stack is the process of removing and emptying any information
that was attached during a previous work or render.

Let's dive into its steps:

- Set the following `root` properties to `null`
  - `finishedWork`
  - `finishedLanes`
  - `timeoutHandle`, will also cancel any existing timeout (to commit)
  - `cancelPendingCommit`
- Reset the work in progress stack
  
  React will do nothing here when coming from `root.render()`, but it will
  reset several Fiber modules and their global variables (their internal state)
  and interrupt any ongoing work. This is normal since we are starting a render
  cycle and things need to [be clean.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1478)
  This process may be the most important and critical to be done correctly.

- Reset the work loop internal state variables

  This involves setting the following variable to their default values:
  - `workInProgressRoot` = `root`
  - `workInProgress` = `createWorkInProgress(root.current, null)`: Pay attention
     to this particular variable involving the creation of a second fiber.
  - `renderLanes` = `lanes`
  - `workInProgressRootRenderLanes` = `lanes`
  - `workInProgressSuspendedReason` = `NotSuspended`
  - `workInProgressThrownValue` = `null`
  - `workInProgressRootDidAttachPingListener` = `false`
  - `workInProgressRootExitStatus` = `RootInProgress`
  - `workInProgressRootFatalError` = `null`
  - `workInProgressRootSkippedLanes` = `NoLanes`
  - `workInProgressRootInterleavedUpdatedLanes` = `NoLanes`
  - `workInProgressRootRenderPhaseUpdatedLanes` = `NoLanes`
  - `workInProgressRootPingedLanes` = `NoLanes`
  - `workInProgressRootConcurrentErrors` = `null`
  - `workInProgressRootRecoverableErrors` = `null`
  
  The `createWorkInProgress` is very important, so we should [visit it too.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiber.js#L269)
  It is responsible for creating a second fiber (the `alternate`) that mirrors
  out FiberNode (`root.current`). We will be seeing it again during the work.

  The alternate is used by react as a `DRAFT` or a `SNAPSHOT` of the ongoing
  work (or render), that once finished will be committed to be the main fiber
  and then the previous main fiber is released.
  
  The `createWorkInProgress` will be revisited again in the next section.

- Finish queuing the concurrent updates

  Do you remember the `concurrentQueues` variable from how `root.render()` works?
  Well, `root.render()` did not do anything to our `root`, but it just
  scheduled its render via microtask queue, and at the same time, it did leave
  the render `children` as an update stored in a global variable; like this:
  ```tsx
  concurrentQueues[id++] = fiber;
  concurrentQueues[id++] = sharedQueue;
  concurrentQueues[id++] = update;
  concurrentQueues[id++] = lane;
  ```
  
  Now is time to [process this array](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f101c2d0d3a6cb5a788a3d91faef48462e45f515/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberConcurrentUpdates.js#L50)
  with the following steps:
  - Loop to the end of this array and each time reference the variables using
    the same order we added them, then remove them from the array by setting
    them to `null`.
    ```tsx
    while (i < end) {
      const fiber: Fiber = concurrentQueues[i];
      concurrentQueues[i++] = null;
      const queue: ConcurrentQueue = concurrentQueues[i];
      concurrentQueues[i++] = null;
      const update: ConcurrentUpdate = concurrentQueues[i];
      concurrentQueues[i++] = null;
      const lane: Lane = concurrentQueues[i];
      concurrentQueues[i++] = null;
    
      // at this point the update is attached to fiber's queue, it wasn't before
      if (queue !== null && update !== null) {
        const pending = queue.pending;
        if (pending === null) {
          update.next = update;
        } else {
          update.next = pending.next;
          pending.next = update;
        }
        queue.pending = update;
      }
      if (lane !== NoLane) {
        // this will make use of the fiber, we've already seen it too in
        // the root.render section.
        // it will merge these lanes starting from this fiber to its root
        // (including alternate if present)
        // highlight-next-line
        markUpdateLaneFromFiberToRoot(fiber, update, lane);
      }
    }
    ```

### 4. Trigger the work loop

Finally, for real this time (almost)! we are there!

React will then start a [`do while(true)`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1877)
loop where it will call `workLoopSync()` (the work loop 🙄). Let's take a look
at the simplified loop:

```tsx
// simplified

do {
  try {
    if (didSuspendDuringHydration) {
      resetWIPStack();
      workInProgressRootExitStatus = RootDidNotComplete;
      break;
    }

     // highlight-next-line
     workLoopSync();
     // Why a break here you wonder ? Hint: there is no break in the catch block
     break;
  } catch (e) {
     // highlight-next-line
     handleThrow(root, e);
  }
} while (true)

```

The [`workLoopSync`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1971)
is defined as:

```tsx
function workLoopSync() {
  // read well the following comment from React codebase, we'll get back to
  // that later
  // highlight-next-line
  // Perform work without checking if we need to yield between fiber.
  while (workInProgress !== null) {
    // highlight-next-line
    performUnitOfWork(workInProgress);
  }
}
```

Here is a simplified version of [how `performUnitOfWork` works:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L2238)

```tsx
// simplified
// the unitOfWork Fiber passed here is the global workInProgress variable
// which was initialized by the fiberRoot.current.alternate

// so basically the workInProgress initially = the alternate
// which means that the 'current' tree is the workInProfress.alternate
function performUnitOfWork(unitOfWork: Fiber): void {
  const current = unitOfWork.alternate;

  // highlight-next-line
  const next = beginWork(current, unitOfWork, renderLanes);
  
  unitOfWork.memoizedProps = unitOfWork.pendingProps;
  if (next === null) {
    // If this doesn't spawn new work, complete the current work.
    // highlight-next-line
    completeUnitOfWork(unitOfWork);
  } else {
    workInProgress = next;
  }
}

```

So begin work will render the fiber and return the next one.

`beginWork` is detailed in its detailed section just after this one, but it is
important to note at this stage that it receives both the current unit of work
and its alternate. it is like: render into the `alternate` the main `fiber`
using the `renderLanes` and return the `next` unit of work.

Like mentioned earlier, the `alternate` refers to the `workInProgerss` while
the original `fiber` will be the `current` tree.

> This is the actual sync work loop: **Keep performing work until there is
> nothing left to do.**

As you may know already, React will construct a fiber tree from the received
`children` to `root.render` and will keep working until it reaches the end.
How they are linked and how the next fiber is chosen will be detailed in a
separate section, this one is for the loop.

### 5. Handle thrown error

If the render phase [did throw an error](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1921)
, it is a sign that React will either show Suspense fallback, show an error
boundary or a blank page.

This process is complex and long and manages many cases, we will dedicate
a whole section for it.

<TBD />

### 6. Restore execution context and dispatcher

So by here the render is completed, React will then proceed to reset some
variables and perform some checks:

```tsx
resetContextDependencies();
restoreExecutionContextAndDispatcher();
throwAsDefensiveIfThereIsStillSomeWorkToDo();
```

- Reset context dependencies
  
  This will reset the context's module internal state (module variables)
  because render [did complete](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/540bab085d571789f4562565eebfd0db9f36345c/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberNewContext.js#L80).

- Restore execution context
  
  ```tsx
  // we've already seen it above
  executionContext = prevExecutionContext;
  ```
  
- Throw if there is still work to do
  
  ```tsx
  if (workInProgress !== null) {
    throw new Error(
      'Cannot commit an incomplete root. This error is likely caused by a ' +
        'bug in React. Please file an issue.',
    );
  }
  ```

### 7. Finish the updates

This is the same process we've seen when preparing a fresh stack, React will
perform a second pass in case another update is scheduled when rendering.

In a simple case, nothing will be done.

## How `renderRootConcurrent` works

There are noticeable differences from the `sync` render, to pass via this
path from `root.render()`, you should satisfy the `shouldTimeSlice` condition.

To do so, the simplest way (if not the only way) is to wrap `root.render()`
with `startTransition`.

In this case, `renderRootConcurrent` is called with the same signature. Let's
dive [into it:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1978)

todo: back to this after begin work and leaf sections
