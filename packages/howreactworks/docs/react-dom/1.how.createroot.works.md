# How `createRoot` works

When following a React tutorial or the docs, the first step that you should do
in order to use React is to import `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`,
then call it by providing a `container`, then call the `render` function from
the resulting `root` object.

```tsx
import { App } from "./app";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById("root");

// This is the first step
// highlight-next-line
const root = createRoot(container);

// Then, the second
// highlight-next-line
root.render(<App />);
```

This section is all about `createRoot` (the first step). We will see its
signature, the purpose of creating the `root` object and what exactly is.

## Signature

`createRoot` is defined as follows, you can see it [here too](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e50531692010bbda2a4627b07c7c810c3770a52a/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOM.js#L115):

```typescript
function createRoot(
  container: Element | Document | DocumentFragment,
  options?: CreateRootOptions
): RootType { /* [Not Native code] */ }
```

`createRoot` accepts a DOM `Node` and returns an object
of type `RootType` (The dom node is often called the `HostRoot`) that you will
use to render your application. We will see the returned object in details 
later in this section.

The second optional argument of `createRoot` is an `options` object. Up until
writing these words, here is the following supported options:

| Property                              | Type                         | Description                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unstable_strictMode`                 | `boolean`                    | Enable/disable StrictMode at root level                                                                      |
| `unstable_concurrentUpdatesByDefault` | `boolean`                    | Make concurrent updates the default for a root.                                                              |
| `unstable_transitionCallbacks`        | `TransitionTracingCallbacks` | I don't know what are these. It will be documented/edited when we get to it.                                 |
| `identifierPrefix`                    | `string`                     | React Flight root's identifierPrefix.                                                                        |
| `onRecoverableError`                  | `(error: any) => void`       | Callback when React auto recovers from errors. Try it [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/stoic-glitter-sstwtq). |

`TransitionTracingCallbacks` are defined [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactInternalTypes.js#L292).

## Implementation

Before diving into the implementation details, which will be a super long
process, I will spoil most of it by putting it in a human-readable format first,
then dig into it step by step afterward.

### Purpose

**__TODO__**

### Implementation steps

1. **Ensure that `container` is a valid React container**:
    
    ```tsx
    if (!isValidContainer(container)) {
      throw new Error('createRoot(...): Target container is not a DOM element.');
    }
    ```
   Valid containers [are](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMRoot.js#L347):
   - [Dom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)
     such as `div`, `p` and so on.
   - The main page's [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)
   - [Document Fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment)
   - [Comments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Comment)
     in React builds that have this feature allowed.
2. **Warn in dev about bad containers**:
   In development builds, you may be [warned](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMRoot.js#L372)
   if you violate one of the following:
   - using `body` as a `container`, which is often used by extensions and third
   party libraries, so it may fool React into reconciliation issues.
   - You previously called the legacy `ReactDOM.render(container, element)`
   on that `container`.
   - You already called `createRoot` with the same `container`.

   So keep these things in mind and avoid them.
3. **Declare variables mirroring and closing over the provided `options`,
   [if present](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMRoot.js#L199).**
   ```tsx
   // simplified
   let isStrictMode = false;
   let identifierPrefix = '';
   // ...other options
   
   if (options) {
     if (options.unstable_strictMode === true) {
       isStrictMode = true;
     }
     // ...
   }
   ```

4. **Call `createContainer` with the information in scope:**
    ```tsx
   const fiberRoot = createContainer(
     container, // the host element
     ConcurrentRoot, // the root type, or RootTag
     null, // hydration callbacks
     isStrictMode, // options?.unstable_strictMode || false
     isConcurrentUpdatesByDefault,  // options?.unstable_concurrentUpdatesByDefault || false
     identifierPrefix, // options?.identifierPrefix || ''
     onRecoverableError, // options?.onRecoverableError || reportError || console.error
     transitionCallbacks, // options?.unstable_transitionCallbacks || null
   );
   ```
   The resulting object has **many** properties, for the sake of clarity of this
   particular section, we will skip over them until later. But we will see
   the creation sequence. `createContainer` itself will delegate [the work](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberReconciler.js#L257)
   to `createFiberRoot` with almost the same parameters, with a `null` value
   for the `initialChildren` and `false` for hydrate (obviously at this point).

   Now that we are at [the real deal](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberRoot.js#L130),
   let's break it step by step:

   1. Create an instance of a `FiberRootNode`
      ```tsx
      const fiberRoot = new FiberRootNode(
        container, // the host element
        tag, // ConcurrentRoot
        hydrate, // false for this path
        identifierPrefix, // options?.identifierPrefix || ''
        onRecoverableError, // options?.onRecoverableError || reportError || console.error
      );
      ```
      This creation [involves](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberRoot.js#L47)
      like mentioned **many** properties, don't worry, you will have a table later
      describing each one of them. But it is important that you sneak peek ðŸ˜‰.
   
   2. Create the first `Fiber` or kind `HostRoot`:
      
      By no doubts you've heard of the famous `Fiber` architecture in React, at
      this point, the first [one is created](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberRoot.js#L164).
  
      One important thing to detect is the [React Mode](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/254cbdbd6d851a30bf3b649a6cb7c52786766fa4/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactTypeOfMode.js#L12),
      React will use it to decide which logic to perform in many cases.
      ```tsx
      // simplified
       const unitializedFiber = new FiberNode(
        HostRoot, // tag
        null, // pendingProps
        null, // key
        mode, // deduced react mode (strict mode, strict effects, concurrent updates..)
      );
      ```
      We've skipped until now two major and important creations: `FiberRootNode`
      and `FiberNode`. We will see them in a few, but it is important that your
      mental model start grasping that, when creating a `root` for React, we
      create a special instance of `FiberRootNode` that will also have an
      attached `FiberNode` to it.
   
   3. Reference `FiberNode` and `FiberRootNode` in each other:
      ```tsx
      fiberRoot.current = unitializedFiber;
      unitializedFiber.stateNode = fiberRoot;
      ``` 

   4. Initialize the `FiberNode`'s `memoizedState`:

      This initialization is conditional as it changes a bit when the `cache`
      feature [is enabled in React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberRoot.js#L172).
      ```tsx
      // simplified
      uninitializedFiber.memoizedState = {
        element: null, // initialChildren
        isDehydrated: false, // hydrate
        cache: null, // put behind a feature flag
      }
      ```
      
   5. Initialize the `FiberNode`'s `updateQueue`:
      [This initialization](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L175)
      creates the `updateQueue` property for our `unintializedFiber`:
      ```tsx
      unitializedFiber.updateQueue = {
        baseState: fiber.memoizedState, // we just created this above
        firstBaseUpdate: null,
        lastBaseUpdate: null,
        shared: {
          pending: null,
          lanes: NoLanes, // 0
          hiddenCallbacks: null,
        },
        callbacks: null,
      };
      ```
      Don't worry, we will explain for what every one of them is used when time
      comes.
   6. Finally, return the `FiberRootNode`:
      ```tsx
      return fiberRoot;
      ``` 
   
5. **Mark the `container` as `Root`**

   Here, React will mutate your provided `container` object by adding a special
   property with a name unique for the [loaded React instance](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b55d31955982851284bb437a5187a6c56e366539/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactDOMComponentTree.js#L72).
   
   ```tsx
   // simplified
   container.__reactContainer$randomValue = fiberRoot.current; // unintializedFiber
   ```

6. **Inject the current `ReactDispatcher`**

   The `Dispatcher` concept in React will have its own section as it has so many
   gotchas.
   
   But to give you an idea, depending on the execution context (react current work,
   react currently rendering component, and so on) it will have a special object
   with many methods that the current code path expect them to be there.
   
   For example, at this point, we attach the `ReactDOMClientDispatcher` which
   is [defined here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e50531692010bbda2a4627b07c7c810c3770a52a/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactFiberConfigDOM.js#L2067).
   
   We will come back to this in a later blog in order to fully explain it too.

7. **Listen to all supported events on the provided `container`**

   As you may be aware of, React implemented a plugin event system that's
   detailed in its own section.

   At this point, React will attach necessary event handlers to the root
   `container` with different priorities.

   You can sneak peek [starting from here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fda1f0b902b527089fe5ae7b3aa573c633166ec9/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/events/DOMPluginEventSystem.js#L406)
   before reading this section later.

8. **Return an instance of type `ReactDOMRoot`**

So this is the final step in `createRoot`, finally!

This step only calls the `ReactDOMRoot` constructor with the resulting
`fiberRoot` object.

The constructor itself only references the given `fiberRoot` into `_internalRoot`,
that you may already have seen if you ever inspected the `root` object.

Besides of the `_internalRoot` property, which is documented in the React docs
and should not be used, there two methods: `render` and `unmount`.

### Recap

Here is a small diagram illustrating the created objects with some of their
properties (unstable and dev properties were omitted for now):

It may be not very readable or beneficial, but [here is](https://codesandbox.io/s/inspiring-monad-r4zkqd?file=/src/index.js)
a codesandbox showing these properties from the created `root` object.

:::warning
During my time working with React, I NEVER used the root object or any of its
properties.

The React team also discourage using them, because you will likely
break React when manipulating them, and they change over time, so they aren't
stable and using them should not be an option.

By now, we have created our FiberRoot object that will allow us to render
our application in the given dom `container`.

In the next section we will read about how `root.render()` works.
