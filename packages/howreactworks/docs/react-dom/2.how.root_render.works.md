# How `root.render()` works

To render a UI using React, you should perform the following as the very first steps:

- Create a `root` object using `createRoot`.
- Call the `root.render(ui)` function.

```tsx
import { App } from "./app";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById("root");

// This is the first step
// highlight-next-line
const root = createRoot(container);

// Then, the second
// highlight-next-line
root.render(<App />);
```

This section is all about the `root.render` function (the second step).
We will see its signature and how it works under the hood.


## Definition
### Declaration

The fiber root `render` method is declared here 
[in `/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMRoot.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMRoot.js#L102)

### Signature

The `render` method is defined as follows:

```tsx
function render(children: ReactNodeList): void {
  // [Not Native Code]
}
```

As opposed to what we mentally call this parameter the `app` or `ui`, in React
code it is referred as `children`, so let's stick to `children` ðŸ˜‰

The type of this parameter is `ReactNodeList`, [which is](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/shared/ReactTypes.js#L22):

```tsx
type ReactNodeList = ReactEmpty | React$Node;

// where:
// highlight-next-line
type ReactEmpty = null | void | boolean;

// and
// highlight-next-line
type React$Node =
  | null
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | React$Element<any>
  | React$Portal
  | Iterable<React$Node>;

// where
// highlight-next-line
type React$Element<ElementType extends React$ElementType> = {
  ref: any,
  type: ElementType,
  key: React$Key | null,
  props: React$ElementProps<ElementType>,
}
```

Having this said, we can several things to the `render` method,
[such as the following](https://codesandbox.io/s/crazy-resonance-jph8kc?file=/src/index.js)
or any complex app you used before:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="html" label="index.html">

```html
    <body>
        <div id="root1"></div>
        <hr />
        <div id="root2"></div>
        <hr />
        <div id="root3"></div>
    </body>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="index.js" default>

```tsx
import React, { createElement } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root1")).render([
  "Hello ",
  <span key="world" style={{ color: "red" }}>
    World!
  </span>
]);

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { initialCount } = this.props;

    return <p>Class Count is: {initialCount}</p>;
  }
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root2")).render([
  <ul key="list">
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Last, not third</li>
  </ul>,
  createElement(
    function FunctionComponent({ initialCount }) {
      return <span>Function Count is: {initialCount}</span>;
    },
    { initialCount: 2, key: "count" }
  ),
  <ClassComponent key="class" initialCount={3} />
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root3")).render([
  null,
  true,
  false,
  undefined
]);
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In a nutshell, you would pass a React Element or a collection of them.
React will then `render` them recursively and display your interactive UI.

## Implementation


As you may have noticed if you clicked on the implementation link, the top level
implementation of `render` would:

1. Throw if the `root._internalRoot (FiberRootNode)` is null, which means that
   the `root.unmount` was called (or done manually).
2. Perform some `__DEV__` mode checks and warnings:
   1. If you pass a second argument of type `function`, like the legacy
      `ReactDOM.render(children, callback)`.
   2. If you pass the `children` as a second argument, it guesses that you
      are using the legacy signature.
   3. If you pass anything as a second argument.
3. call `updateContainer(children, root, null, null)`.

```tsx
// simplified
ReactDOMRoot.prototype.render = function render(children: ReactNodeList): void {
    const root = this._internalRoot;
    if (root === null) {
      throw new Error('Cannot update an unmounted root.');
    }
    
    // dev checks
    
    updateContainer(children, root, null, null);
}
```

## `updateContainer`
`updateContainer` is a function called from many places in the React codebase,
you may be wondering why it is called `update` and not `render` or even `mount` ?
It is because for React all the work is done via this function, and if it
detects in a subtree that it is actually a `mount` it will do so.

It is important to analyze [this function:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberReconciler.js#L318)

#### Signature

```tsx
export function updateContainer(
  element: ReactNodeList, // children
  container: OpaqueRoot, // OpaqueRoot = FiberRoot = new FiberRootNode
  parentComponent?: React$Component<any, any>,
  callback?: Function,
): Lane {
  // [Not Native Code]
}
```

This function does a lot of things, and is used now when `mounting` our tree
for the first time and later on updates.

The last two parameters were passed as `null` when coming from `root.render`,
which means that they aren't used. We will talk about them only when necessary
though.

### 1. **Reference the `current` attached `Fiber`**

   The `container` passed here isn't the same as the `DOMElement` you passed
   to `createRoot`. This one is the `root._internalRoot` which is a `FiberRootNode`.
   
   The `container.current` property is of type `FiberNode` if you remember from
   the previous blog, which is the very first `Fiber` you application created
   until now.

   ```tsx
   const current = container.current;
   ```

### 2. **Request an update Lane**

   The next thing React does is to request an update lane (a number) for the
   current `Fiber`:
   
   ```tsx
   const lane = requestUpdateLane(current);
   ```
   
   This is our first real `Lanes` encounter, so we've got to explain them
   briefly:
   
   A `lane` is a natural number whose value isn't important directly, it is
   manipulated using bitwise operators to combine several states into one number.
   They are defined [here in the React codebase](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L18).
   You can see the used lanes such as: `SyncLane`, `InputContinuousLane`,
   `IdleLane`, `OffscreenLane` and so on...

   So React will use these natural numbers with bitwise masks to detect the
   capabilities and behavior of any unit of work. We will be seing these Lanes
   all over again and again.

   The [`requestUpdateLane`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L606)
   will use the `fiber.mode` (from `FiberNode`) to infer the necessary update
   lane among other variables, this function is called on runtime too after
   the initial render, so we will go through it as is:

   - If the mode isn't concurrent (`(mode & ConcurrentMode) === NoMode`), then
     the `SyncLane`(`2`) is returned.
   - If it is a __render phase update__ (calling `setState` during render), then
     the [highest priority lane is returned](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L527):
     `lane & -lane` technically, which will be equal (generally) for a number n,
     to `n & -n = 2^k` where k is the position of the rightmost set bit in the
     binary representation of n. So we will refer to this gymnastic with
     `highestPriorityLane` in the future (or, the smallest `Lane` present
     in the given `Lanes` number).
     ```tsx
     // let say we have this arbitrary lanes number:
     // 0b000_1011_0000
     // the highest priotiry lane would be 0b000_0001_0000
     ```
     
      So, when updating a container from a render phase update, React will
      take the highest priority Lane (the lanes definitions are smartly ordered).
   - If the update occurs within a `Transition` (yes, you can do 
      `startTransition(() => { root.render(children); })`), then it will select
      from the `TransitionLanes` [defined here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L52)
      and upgrade and/or reset the next transition [lane to claim](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L506).
   - If the global [`currentUpdatePriority`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f101c2d0d3a6cb5a788a3d91faef48462e45f515/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactEventPriorities.js#L29)
     is set and different from `NoLane` (`0`), then it will be returned.
   - If none of the previous conditions match, React assumes that the
     update originated from outside React, and then will ask the `Host`
     environment to give `getCurrentEventPriority()`, which in our `DOM` case,
     will use `window.event` to infer [its priority.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e50531692010bbda2a4627b07c7c810c3770a52a/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactFiberConfigDOM.js#L597)

### 3. **Resolve and attach the subtree context**
   
   Next, React will infer and attach [`container(FiberRootNode).context`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberReconciler.js#L334)
   if it is null, or attach to `container.pendingContext` if already defined.
   This context property is to be detailed later.

### 4. **Create an `update` Object**

   If you remember from the [previous chapter](/docs/react-dom/how.createroot.works#recap), 
   our `FiberNode` has an `UpdateQueue` that's used to collect `pending` updates,
   our first real `Update` object is [created here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/80d9a40114bb43c07d021e8254790852f450bd2b/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberReconciler.js#L358)
   for the given Lane:
   ```tsx
     // closure vars:
     // - element: chilren or ui, the node passed to root.render()
     // - callback: last parameter to updateContainer, null from root.render()
   
   
     // simplified
     const update = {
       lane,
       tag: UpdateState, // 0
       
       callback, // callback or null
       payload: {element}, // element are the root children
       
       next: null,
     };
   ```

### 5. **Enqueue the created update to the `Fiber`**

   At this point, we are aware of the `updateLane` and have created an `Update`
   to be applied on our `FiberRoot` containing our UI as a payload,
   but not right away! React needs to properly schedule the processing of this 
   update.

   To do so, the first step is to add this update to the queue:
   ```tsx
   const root: FiberRoot | null = enqueueUpdate(current, update, lane);
   
   // current: FiberNode
   // update: Update
   // lane: number (update lane)
   ```

   `enqueueUpdate` will pass through the following steps:
   1. return `null` if the `fiber.updateQueue` is null. `null` is only returned
      from this path and means that this `fiber` [has been unmounted.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L227)
   2. Warn in dev about nested `setState` calls: calling `setState` from with
      the same `setState(prev => next)`. This warning will be only from class
      component, for function components, the latest `setState` class wins.
      Here is a codesandbox [showing both cases](https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-noether-nxlcxv?file=/src/App.js).
      
      <details>
        <summary>calling setState from within setState warning</summary>
        This snippet showcases how to force that warning to be shown in dev,
        and how there is no warning from hooks setState.

        ```tsx
        // this code is for demo purpose only
        
        let instance;
        class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
          state = { value: "" };
          render() {
            instance = this;
            return this.state.value;
          }
        }
        
        let setState;
        function FunctionComponent() {
          let [state, _setState] = React.useState("");
          setState = _setState;
          return state;
        }
        
        function App() {
          React.useEffect(() => {
            instance.setState(() => {
              console.log("setting class component state");
              // this call will warn in dev and considers this setState every time
              // highlight-next-line
              instance.setState({ value: "Hello !" });
              // highlight-next-line
              return { value: "This value is ignored" };
              });
            setState(() => {
              console.log("setting function component state");
              // the state returned here is unstable since it will output a different value
              // depending on whether you have StrictMode enabled, which should help you
              // see that this is not the intended behavior.
              // Change unstable_strictMode: false in index.js to see a behavior change.
              // A warning here would be also necessary.
              // highlight-next-line
              setState("Another value");
              // highlight-next-line
              return "World !";
            });
          }, []);
          
          return (
            <div>
              <ClassComponent />
              <FunctionComponent />
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
      </details>

   3. If the update is a render phase class component update (not function 
      component `useState` or `useReducer` hook), then:
      1. Add this update to the circular queue `fiber.updateQueue.shared.pending`:
         If there are already pending updates, the new update is put first,
         and then the existing pending update, which references the new
         update. [See it here.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L252)
         When processing this `pending` queue that has at most two elements,
         it will start by disconnecting them and start [with the second.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L487)
      2. Traverse the tree up to the `root` searching for the `FiberRootNode`
         of this tree. Let's dive into this process:
         ```tsx
         return unsafe_markUpdateLaneFromFiberToRoot(fiber, lane);
         ```
         1. Traverse the tree the first time via `getRootForUpdatedFiber(fiber)`
            searching for the `Fiber` that has a `fiber.return` equal to `null`
            with a `HostRoot` `tag`.
            While traversing, React was in the meantime counting the nested
            updates and will throw if it [detects any anomaly.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f101c2d0d3a6cb5a788a3d91faef48462e45f515/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberConcurrentUpdates.js#L253)
         2. The Second traversal via `markUpdateLaneFromFiberToRoot(root, null, lane)`
            would add the obtained `updateLane` to all the parents encountered
            until [reaching the `HostRoot`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f101c2d0d3a6cb5a788a3d91faef48462e45f515/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberConcurrentUpdates.js#L194),
            While looping, it would add special cases for `OffscreenComponents`,
            we will leave this for a later section.
   4. If the update isn't a class component render one, which is the default
      branching when coming from `root.render()`, then it will
      `return enqueueConcurrentClassUpdate(fiber, sharedQueue, update, lane)`
      ```tsx
      // definition, simplified
      export function enqueueConcurrentClassUpdate<State>(
      // ... params
      ): FiberRoot | null {
        // the update with our {element} as payload gets queued here
        // highlight-next-line
        enqueueUpdate(fiber, sharedQueue, update, lane);
        // we've already seen getRootForUpdatedFiber to traverse the tree
        // looking the HostRoot Fiber when passing through the unsafe render
        // phase class component update above
        return getRootForUpdatedFiber(fiber);
      }
      ```
      
      `enqueueUpdate` this time does [the following](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f101c2d0d3a6cb5a788a3d91faef48462e45f515/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberConcurrentUpdates.js#L89)
      (Please ignore the comment about rendering there for now, we are surely
      not rendering yet):
      1. Capture in a global `concurrentQueues` the 4 arguments:
         ```tsx
         // simplified
         concurrentQueues[id++] = fiber;
         concurrentQueues[id++] = sharedQueue;
         concurrentQueues[id++] = update;
         concurrentQueues[id++] = lane;
         ```
         This global variable is reset, among many others in specific places
         in React. You will get to see all of them later, each one when its time
         comes.
      2. Add the `lane`(`updateLane`) to the global `concurrentlyUpdatedLanes`:
         ```tsx
         // simplified
         concurrentlyUpdatedLanes |= lane;
         ```
      3. Merge the lane into the `fiber` (`fiberRoot.current`) and its
         `alternate` (Oh! The `alternate`!):
         ```tsx
         fiber.lanes = mergeLanes(fiber.lanes, lane);
         const alternate = fiber.alternate;
         if (alternate !== null) {
           alternate.lanes = mergeLanes(alternate.lanes, lane);
         }
         ```
      
      Finally, the `HostRoot` is returned via `getRootForUpdatedFiber(fiber)`.
   
   :::note
   Either ways, we obtained now our `HostRoot` which is of type `FiberRootNode`,
   calling `enqueueUpdate(currentFiber, update, lane)` returned the `HostRoot`
   of our tree.
   :::

We will do a small recap so that you are not lost here:

We started by `root.render(children)`, In `root.render` we've:
- used the `fiberRoot.current` (the very first created Fiber until now)
- requested an update lane which depends on many factors, such as
  Transition, root `mode` and so on.
- Resolve the top level react `context` object.
- Create an `Update` object.
- Enqueue this `update` on the `Fiber`'s `updateQueue`.
  
The last part returned the `HostRoot` (of prototype `FiberNode`) and we
are here now. Let's continue.
         
### 6. **Schedule the current `Fiber` update**

   WUp until now, our current `fiber` has a non-empty `updateQueue` holding our
   `children` as a payload. Now, we need to schedule an update on the current
   fiber via:
   ```tsx
   scheduleUpdateOnFiber(fiberRoot, currentFiber, updateLane);
   ```

   The `scheduleUpdateOnFiber` function is called from many places in React,
   and is the way to React is told to `render` something.
   This function is called from state setters and hooks and many other places
   from the React codebase.

   Since we will be revisiting it later many times, we will now provide an
   introduction at how this function works, we may skip over code paths
   that aren't relevant for now.

   Let's break [into it:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L683)
   1. Warn in dev if the update is scheduled when running `insertion effects`
   2. When the `root` is `in progress` and `SuspendedOnData`, then a many
      global variables used by React [will be reset.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L711)
      This section up until using `root.render(children)` isn't relevant, we
      will come back to this in a later section.
   3. Mark the `root` as updated:
      This process, as you may have guessed, will add the `updateLane` to the
      `root`'s property: the `pendingLanes`, which refers to the pending root's
       work.
       
       Then, if this `update` isn't `Idle` (which is the case coming from
       `root.render(children)`), then we will reset two properties from the `root`:
       the `suspendedLanes` and `pingedLanes`: The reasoning behind this is that
       this update could unblock or un-suspend a tree, so these properties are
       cleared to the tree will attempt to render again.
       ```tsx
      export function markRootUpdated(root: FiberRoot, updateLane: Lane) {
        root.pendingLanes |= updateLane;

        if (updateLane !== IdleLane) {
          root.suspendedLanes = NoLanes;
          root.pingedLanes = NoLanes;
        }
      }
      ```
   4. If the update is a `render phase update`, then you will be warned if the
      update is from another component.
   5. If the update is a `normal` one, then:
      1. [`ensureRootIsScheduled(root)`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L796)
         is called which will:
         1. reference this root in at least one of the global
            `firstScheduledRoot` and `lastScheduledRoot` variables.
         2. schedule a microtask via [`scheduleMicrotask`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7f362de1588d98438787d652941533e21f2f332d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberRootScheduler.js#L470)
            that will [`processRootScheduleInMicrotask`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7f362de1588d98438787d652941533e21f2f332d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberRootScheduler.js#L233)
            which will loop over `scheduledRoots` and process them.
            ```tsx
            scheduleImmediateTask(processRootScheduleInMicrotask)
            ```
         
            The processing isn't executed but only scheduled, let's skip it
            for now, it will be detailed later.
      2. Will flush the updates right away if the [`root` is `Legacy`.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dd480ef923930c8906a02664b01bcdea50707b5d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L798)

### 7. **Entangle the `Fiber`'s transitions**

This is the last step in this section, congrats if you've made it till here, this
is a proof that you are curious and ambitious enough, this section was long and
complex, but this is the last part of it.

If your initial code looks like this:
```tsx
createRoot(container).render(children);
```

Then nothing will be done in [this function](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L274),
but if you wrap `render` function inside `startTransition` then
- The `fiber`'s `shared.lanes` will be intersected with the `root`'s
  [`pendingLanes`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L290).
  This will leave only common lanes present in both of them. This means that if
  the `pendingLanes` representing the `nextLanes` no longer contain some lanes
  then they are removed from the shared queue.
- Then merged with the `updateLane` which will contain a `TransitionLane` in
  [this case](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L293),
  and then assigned into the `fiber.updateQueue.shared.lanes`
- The last step will be to [`markRootEntangled(root, newQueueLanes)`:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L673)
  This is a complex process, so let's get into it step by step:
  1. Add the `newQueueLanes` to the `root.entangledLanes`.
  2. Reference the `root.entanglements` array before the loop.
  3. Reference them as a `lanes` variable, then, while this `lanes` isn't `0`:
     1. Compute current [`lanes` index:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L690)
        The index is equal to `31` minus the count of [leading zeros](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/clz32)
        of the current `lanes` number. Which is the position of the first
        significant bit (`1`) of the binary representation of current `lanes`.
     2. Since the `lanes` number may be a composition of multiple lanes together,
        the `lane` at the most significant bit can be computed by shifting to
        the left from `1` the obtained index:
        ```tsx
        const lane = 1 << index;
        
        // explanation:
        // Let's assume we have a lanes of 21, which is:
        // lanes = 0b0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0001_0101 = 21
        // clz32(lanes) = 27
        // 31 - clz32(lanes) = 31 - 27 = 4
        // 1 << 4 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0001_0000
        // which is the lane with the highest number (lowest in priority ;) )
        ```
     3. If The lane exists in the `newQueueLanes` and is transitively entangled
        with the `newQueueLanes`, then the `newQueueLanes` [are added to the](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc801116c80b68f7ebdaf66ac77d5f2dcd9e50eb/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberLane.js#L689)
        `lane`'s entanglements (`root.entanglements`):
        ```tsx
        // very simplified
        // non-zero will be equal to the lane itself
        const laneOrZero = lane & newQueueLanes;
        
        // the existing entanglements at index
        const entagledLanesAtIndex = entanglements[index];
        // lanes that were entangled interseting with new queue lanes
        // those are lanes that will were already and are coming again
        const persistingLanesAtIndex = entagledLanesAtIndex & newQueueLanes;
        
        // this means that either this lane is directly present in the new lanes
        // or that it is transitively present from the previous entanglements
        if (laneOrZero | persistingLanesAtIndex) {
          // add the new lanes to the existing entanglements
          entanglements[index] |= newQueueLanes;
        }
        ```
     4. Remove the current `lane` from the `lanes` and continue the loop until
        we reach `0`.
     
With this `updateContainer(children, root, null, null)` comes to an end, finally. 
        
### Recap

`root.render(children)` main purpose now that we've gone through is the call
the `updateContainer` function, which will create an update object and then
queue it to the `root._internalRoot.current.shared.pending` while referencing
our `children` as `element` into its `payload`.

While doing this, React performs many checks on the original of the update source,
most of them won't be truthy from `root.render()`, but it is important to know
them.

The most important part until now is the
`scheduleImmediateTask(processRootScheduleInMicrotask)` that we left above: it
did schedule some code to be executed later, but we haven't gone through it yet.
That's for a good reason: The work loop will start.

:::note
We've seen `createRoot(container, options)` and `root.render(children)` under
the hood and the huge amount of work done, but React still did not render any
of your components yet, all it did is to schedule the work via `queueMicrotask`.

This means, ehem, that React will render your components once the scripts
in your `index.js` file finishes ðŸ˜‰.

You can take this opportunity to trigger the important data loading parts so
that you can enter the `pending` state or suspend initially, without passing
by an effect or anything. For example, start resolving the current user.
