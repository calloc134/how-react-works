# How beginWork works

Begin works is the function in React that will render your application.

We invoked it in the previous section like this:

```tsx
// simplified
function performUnitOfWork(unitOfWork: Fiber): void {
  const current = unitOfWork.alternate;

  // current: the original fiber: what's visible on the screen
  // unitOfWork: the alternate fiber: the current ongoing render
  // renderLanes: were globally assigned in prepareFreshStack
  // highlight-next-line
  const next = beginWork(current, unitOfWork, renderLanes);
  
  // ... rest of the code
}

```

## Signature
`beingWork` is defined [as follows:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L4002)

```tsx
function beginWork(
  current: Fiber | null, // the current fiber's tree
  workInProgress: Fiber, // the alternate
  renderLanes: Lanes,
): Fiber | null { /* [Not Native Code] */ }
```

It returns the next unit of work, we will see how it calculates it. The next 
unit of work will be the alternate of the next current fiber.

## Implementation

React components can be rendered several times in their lifetime, the `alternate`
is created for each render that occurs as a draft of the next version of the
component's output.

`beginWork`'s simplified version looks like this:

```tsx
function beginWork(
  current,
  wip,
  lanes
) {
  if (current !== null) {
    // this component is updating
  } else {
    // this component renders for the first time
    
  }
}
```

### Attempt early bailout if applicable

So `beginWork` will first check if we deal with a re-render, this is not the
case when coming from `root.render()` but we will get into it anyway. Because
this code path is visited at every render.

:::note
Even when coming from `root.render`, the `HostRoot` fiber will have the
`alternate` created since we created it when preparing a fresh stack. But not
the rest of the tree.
:::

So, when the alternate already exists:

- Reference the `oldProps` (`current.memoizedProps`) and `newProps` (
  `alternate(wip).pendingProps`):
  ```tsx
  const oldProps = current.memoizedProps;
  const newProps = workInProgress.pendingProps;
  ```

- If the `oldProps` and `newProps` aren't the same (meaning a triggered render 
  from the parent component) or the [legacy context changed,](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L4032)
  then it mark the component as did receive update.
- When props did change, it will check if there is a scheduled update or some
  context changed:
  - The component received an update means that the alternate `lanes` intersect
    with the `renderLanes` (do a pause a think about it).
  - Contexts are stored as `fiber.dependencies` in a linked list, so it will
    iterate through all of them and compare the context's value.
  
  When nothing changed, React will attempt to [bail out the render](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L3788)
  for this component and its children if possible. We will see the bailout
  in its dedicated section.
- When the `current` is `null` (first render of a component),
  then it will mark the component as it did not receive an update, then it will 
  perform some hydration related stuff. This is out of our scope for now.

Let's put the previous words into code:

```tsx
// simplified
function beginWork(
  current: Fiber | null, // the painted fiber if any (garanteed for HostRoot)
  workInProgress: Fiber, // the pending rendered fiber
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  if (current !== null) {
    const oldProps = current.memoizedProps;
    const newProps = workInProgress.pendingProps;
    
    if (oldProps !== newProps || hasLegacyContextChanged()) {
      didReceivedUpdate = true;
    } else {
      if (
        hasScheduledUpdateOrContext(current, renderLanes) &&
        // more on this later
        (workInProgress.flags & DidCapture === NoFlags)
      ) {
        didReceiveUpdate = false;
        return attemptEarlyBailoutIfNoScheduledUpdate(
          current,
          workInProgress,
          renderLanes,
        );
      }
    }
  } else {
    didReceiveUpdate = false;
    // out of our scope code
  }
}
```

:::note
As a recap, `beginWork` would attempt to bail out the work if not needed.
This is not the only work bailout on React, we will see it several times again.
:::

### Render the components
Right next, React will perform a huge [switch statement](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L4098)
over [`workInProgress.tag`.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6396b664118442f3c2eae7bf13732fcb27bda98f/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactWorkTags.js#L10)

The goal of this switch is to redirect to the right function that will perform
the render on the current fiber.

We will see the `workTag`s in details in the next section, so for now, let's
just scratch the surface when coming from `root.render()`. Then in the next
section, we will dive into the work tags and how they work before visiting
the render of each one of them.


```tsx
// simplified
function beginWork(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  
  // previous code
  
  switch(workInProgress.tag) {
    // case FunctionComponent:
    // case ClassComponent:
    // case IndeterminateComponent:
    // highlight-next-line
    case HostRoot:
      // highlight-next-line
      return updateHostRoot(current, workInProgress, renderLanes);
    // case HostPortal:
    // case HostComponent:
    // case HostText:
    // case Fragment:
    // case Mode:
    // case ContextConsumer:
    // case ContextProvider:
    // case ForwardRef:
    // case Profiler:
    // case SuspenseComponent:
    // case MemoComponent:
    // case SimpleMemoComponent:
    // case LazyComponent:
    // case IncompleteClassComponent:
    // case DehydratedFragment:
    // case SuspenseListComponent:
    // case ScopeComponent:
    // case OffscreenComponent:
    // case LegacyHiddenComponent:
    // case CacheComponent:
    // case TracingMarkerComponent:
    // case HostHoistable:
    // case HostSingleton:
  }

  throw new Error(
    `Unknown unit of work tag (${workInProgress.tag}). This error is likely caused by a bug in ` +
    'React. Please file an issue.',
  );
}
```

So as you see, there is a case for every supported tag.

For the very first render while having the `HostRoot` fiber, we'll return
`updateHostRoot(current, workInProgress, renderLanes)`.

Let's scratch [`updateHostRoot` too.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L1443)

PS: This illustrates the first ever render of the root.

```tsx

function updateHostRoot(
  current: null | Fiber,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  // we will ignore this for now
  pushHostRootContext(workInProgress);

  // defensive guard; the root fiber always has the current and alternate
  if (current === null) {
    throw new Error('Should have a current fiber. This is a bug in React.');
  }
  
  const nextProps = workInProgress.pendingProps; // nextProps is null
  
  const prevState = workInProgress.memoizedState; // { element: null }

  const prevChildren = prevState.element; // prevChildren = null

  // highlight-next-line
  cloneUpdateQueue(current, workInProgress);
  // highlight-next-line
  processUpdateQueue(workInProgress, nextProps, null, renderLanes);
  
  // let's stop here for now, since the next code would assume that
  // the updateQueue processing is done and would use properties accordingly
  // we will continue the code after explaining clone and process the queue
}

```

#### Cloning the `updateQueue`

The `updateQueue` was defined in how `createRoot` works and its pending
share queue was populated during how `root.render` works.

Now, and assuming we reach this path from the first render and during the
runtime of the app, [this function](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L189)
will attach a new cloned `updateQueue` to the `alternate` if it has the
`same queue` as the `current` `fiber`.

```tsx
function cloneUpdateQueue<State>(
  current: Fiber,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
): void {
  // Clone the update queue from current. Unless it's already a clone.
  const queue: UpdateQueue<State> = workInProgress.updateQueue;
  const currentQueue: UpdateQueue<State> = current.updateQueue;
  
  if (queue === currentQueue) {
    const clone: UpdateQueue<State> = {
      baseState: currentQueue.baseState,
      firstBaseUpdate: currentQueue.firstBaseUpdate,
      lastBaseUpdate: currentQueue.lastBaseUpdate,
      shared: currentQueue.shared, // shared.pending is what's intersting here
      callbacks: null,
    };
    workInProgress.updateQueue = clone;
  }
}
```

#### Processing the update queue
This process is long and very complex, I will simplify it a lot and move on
because it is not that interesting at this stage, we will see it again.

This cloning and processing paths are achievable from `HostRoot`s,
`ClassComponent`s and the upcoming experimental `CacheComponent`s.

The pending queue being cyclic and has at most two entries, the most recent
as the last. It will be disconnected and then processed in a big [`while(true)`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L536)
loop.

This section will be moved into the annex, it is highly complex and would take 
a lot of time to be explained.

Here is a simplified version that would allow us continuing the render phase:

```tsx

// coming from root.render(), we have only one update in a cyclic way
prepareTheOrderOfUpdatesToProcess();

let update = firstBaseUpdate;
let newState = queue.baseState;
do {
  const queue = workInProgress.updateQueue;
  // highlight-next-line
  newState = getStateFromUpdate(wip, queue, update, newState, props);
  
  if (update.callback) {
    queue.callbacks.push(update.callback);
  }

  // highlight-next-line
  update = update.next;
  
  // no pending update
  if (update === null) {
    if (queue.shared.pending === null) {
      // highlight-next-line
      break;
    } else {
      update = appendPendingUpdates();
    }
  }
} while (true);

workInProgress.lanes = newLanes;
workInProgress.memoizedState = newState;

```

The [`getStateFromUpdate`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4bbac04cd3624962900bb7800ba4f9609d3a1fd3/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberClassUpdateQueue.js#L383)
will switch over the `update.tag` (update state for now), which will result in
a state with `{ element }` containing the `children` we gave to `root.render()`.

Let's now get back to `updateHostRoot`:

```tsx

function updateHostRoot(
  current: null | Fiber,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  // we will ignore this for now
  pushHostRootContext(workInProgress);

  // defensive guard; the root fiber always has the current and alternate
  if (current === null) {
    throw new Error('Should have a current fiber. This is a bug in React.');
  }
  const nextProps = workInProgress.pendingProps; // nextProps was null here
  const prevState = workInProgress.memoizedState; // { element: null }
  const prevChildren = prevState.element; // prevChildren = null

  cloneUpdateQueue(current, workInProgress);
  processUpdateQueue(workInProgress, nextProps, null, renderLanes);

  // highlight-next-line
  // we are here now

  // nextState = {element: children, isDehydrated: false, cache: {...} }
  const nextState: RootState = workInProgress.memoizedState;
  const root: FiberRoot = workInProgress.stateNode;
  const nextChildren = nextState.element;

  // highlight-next-line
  if (nextChildren === prevChildren) {
    // highlight-next-line
    return bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork(current, workInProgress, renderLanes);
    // highlight-next-line
  }
  // highlight-next-line
  reconcileChildren(current, workInProgress, nextChildren, renderLanes);
  
  return workInProgress.child;
}
```

`bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork` and `reconcileChildren` are key functions during
render and are called from many places, they deserve their own chapter.

During the first render, we won't pass through `bailoutOnAlreadyFinishedWork`,
but `reconcileChildren` is a key here! So let's [scratch it too:](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/eaa696876ee40bb048727aefe995be1bbb7384a8/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L326)

```tsx

export function reconcileChildren(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  nextChildren: any,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  // initial mount of fibers, HostRoot won't pass here
  if (current === null) {
    workInProgress.child = mountChildFibers(
      workInProgress,
      null,
      nextChildren,
      renderLanes,
    );
  } else {
    // highlight-next-line
    workInProgress.child = reconcileChildFibers(
      workInProgress, // the returnFiber (the parent of the children)
      current.child, // the current painted first child
      nextChildren, // the new first child
      renderLanes, // the lanes used during this render (DefaultLane from root.render)
    );
  }
}
```

When processing the `HostRoot` fiber, the current always exists and thus
`reconcileChildFibers` will call [`reconcileChildFibers`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/afea1d0c536e0336735b0ea5c74f635527b65785/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1485)
which resets thenable counter then calls [`reconcileChildFibersImpl`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/afea1d0c536e0336735b0ea5c74f635527b65785/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1344)
with the same arguments.


### How `reconcileChildFibersImpl` works
This function is responsible for rendering the `children`, like we saw earlier
the children can be of many forms, such as an `array` of elements, `string`...
and so on.

```tsx
function reconcileChildFibersImpl(
  returnFiber: Fiber,
  currentFirstChild: Fiber | null,
  newChild: any,
  lanes: Lanes,
): Fiber | null {
  // [Not Native Code]
}
```
Let dive into this function step by step:

1. Skip over unkeyed top level fragment
   
   First, React will verify if you top level child is a `Fragment` without a key
   props. If that's the case, then it will [skip over that `Fragment`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/afea1d0c536e0336735b0ea5c74f635527b65785/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1364)
   ```tsx
   // unkeyed top level fragment is know like this:
   const isUnkeyedTopLevelFragment =
      typeof newChild === 'object' &&
      newChild !== null &&
      newChild.type === REACT_FRAGMENT_TYPE &&
      newChild.key === null;
   
   if (isUnkeyedTopLevelFragment) {
     newChild = newChild.props.children;
   }
   ```
2. When the given children are a non-null object then it will switch over the
   [`$$typeof` property.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/afea1d0c536e0336735b0ea5c74f635527b65785/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1370)
   Dan gave a great blog post [about this property].(https://overreacted.io/why-do-react-elements-have-typeof-property/)

   ```tsx
   if (typeof newChild === 'object' && newChild !== null) {
     switch(newChild.$$typeof) {
       case REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE: {
         // highlight-next-line
         return placeSingleChild(
         // highlight-next-line
           reconcileSingleElement(returnFiber, currentFirstChild, newChild, lanes)
         );
       }
       case REACT_PORTAL_TYPE: {
         // highlight-next-line
         return placeSingleChild(
         // highlight-next-line
           reconcileSinglePortal(returnFiber, currentFirstChild, newChild, lanes)
         );
       }
       case REACT_LAZY_TYPE: {
         // ignore for now
       }
     }
   }
   if (isArray(newChild)) {
     // highlight-next-line
     // this will be delayed to the future
     return reconcileChildrenArray(returnFiber, currentFirstChild, newChild, lanes);
   }
   
   if (getIteratorFn(newChild)) {
     // highlight-next-line
     // this will be delayed to the future
     return reconcileChildrenIterator(returnFiber, currentFirstChild, newChild, lanes);
   }
   ```
   [`reconcileChildrenArray`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/afea1d0c536e0336735b0ea5c74f635527b65785/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L835)
   and [`reconcileChildrenIterator`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/afea1d0c536e0336735b0ea5c74f635527b65785/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactChildFiber.js#L1002)
   will be revisited later.
   
3. If the children are an object when a `.then` function property
   (`async components 😉`), then the promise will be unwrapped and its result
   is given to `reconcileChildFibersImpl` again:
   ```tsx
   if (typeof newChild.then === "function") {
     return reconcileChildFibersImpl(
       returnFiber,
       currentFirstChild,
       unwrapThenable(newChild),
       lanes
     );
   }
   ```
   :::warning
   Async components are experimental and not well-supported in the client
   since any render will output a new Promise and thus remove the previous tree.
   Don't use them without a caching strategy (they were originally designed
   for the server were they are invoked once per request.).
   :::

:::tip
As you may have noticed already, the reconciliation passes before the actual
render.

The goal of the reconciliation is to port the next tree to the alternate
that we created from the current.

At this stage coming from `root.render()` there is not even a Fiber created
for out children, so the first step will be to create it.
:::

### how `reconcileSingleElement` works

This is actually a part of the reconciliation which has its own section.

The first thing this function does it to verify from the `currentFirstChild`
if `key` or `type` changed then it will remove the child by adding it
to a `deletions` property in the `parentFiber`. This will keep track of
deleted fibers so that we can invoke their cleanup effects in the commit phase.

Next, this function will create and return a new fiber for our application:

```tsx
const created = createFiberFromElement(element, returnFiber.mode, lanes);
```

When coming from `root.render()`, the first fiber created by this will be the
third of our journey:
- The first is the current fiber attached to the fiber root
- The second is its alternate
- The third (at least) is for the first child we gave to `root.render()`

:::important
By now, we have two unexplained major sections:

1. The big `switch-case` in the `beginWork` function, it will be explained in
   the `how rendering works` section.
2. How `reconcileSingleElement` works and how fibers are created, which will be
   explained in the how `the reconciliation works` section.

To avoid making this section very huge, we will move them next.
:::

## Recap

`beginWork` is called inside `performUnitOfWork(workInProgress)` which will
be responsible for reconciling the children for the next tree before rendering
it.


```tsx
// simplified in renderSync
while(unitOfWork !== null) {
  performUnitOfWork(unitOfWork);
}


function beginWork(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
) {
  if (current !== null) {
    const oldProps = current.memoizedProps;
    const newProps = workInProgress.pendingProps;

    if (oldProps !== newProps || hasLegacyContextChanged()) {
      didReceivedUpdate = true;
    } else {
      if (
              hasScheduledUpdateOrContext(current, renderLanes) &&
              // more on this later
              (workInProgress.flags & DidCapture === NoFlags)
      ) {
        didReceiveUpdate = false;
        return attemptEarlyBailoutIfNoScheduledUpdate(
                current,
                workInProgress,
                renderLanes,
        );
      }
    }
  } else {
    didReceiveUpdate = false;
    // out of our scope code
  }
  
  switch(workInProgress.tag) {
    // case FunctionComponent:
    // case ClassComponent:
    // case IndeterminateComponent:
    // highlight-next-line
    case HostRoot:
      // highlight-next-line
      return updateHostRoot(current, workInProgress, renderLanes);
    // case HostPortal:
    // case HostComponent:
    // case HostText:
    // case Fragment:
    // case Mode:
    // case ContextConsumer:
    // case ContextProvider:
    // case ForwardRef:
    // case Profiler:
    // case SuspenseComponent:
    // case MemoComponent:
    // case SimpleMemoComponent:
    // case LazyComponent:
    // case IncompleteClassComponent:
    // case DehydratedFragment:
    // case SuspenseListComponent:
    // case ScopeComponent:
    // case OffscreenComponent:
    // case LegacyHiddenComponent:
    // case CacheComponent:
    // case TracingMarkerComponent:
    // case HostHoistable:
    // case HostSingleton:
  }

  throw new Error(
    `Unknown unit of work tag (${workInProgress.tag}). This error is likely caused by a bug in ` +
    'React. Please file an issue.',
  );
}
```

`updateHostRoot` will process the updateQueue of our top level root object,
which will result in a new tree to be rendered. Which is what we will see in the
next section.
