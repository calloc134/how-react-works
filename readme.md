## Note to initial viewers & collaborators

Hey guys, thanks for being interested in this project.

So the purpose of this project is to dive into the implementation details of
React and explain how things works. It is not actual coding with more of a
documentation. I just started few weeks ago and my main
focus is on React code exploration and information gathering.

This project would need a lot of help from you guys if possible.
For example, here is the list of things I would like you to help me with, please:

- Feedback, feedback... The most important thing for me is how you find the
  project ? Is the idea interesting, or I should go invest my efforts
  somewhere else ?
- Rewording, I'm bad at it, and sometimes I think that I explained something very
  good, but in reality it is only me that will understand. For this, please feel
  free to criticize any sentence and fill a PR with either a `todo` annotation
  around it, or if you find a better wording, why not.
- Deployment, this project should be automatically deployed in either github
  pages or at Vercel.
- Figures and diagrams: People will understand better with figures mostly
  for stack traces to resume the work of functions, I still need to make those
  and put them in all functions. This can be a React component that I can import
  into the markdown files and use directly.
- Many more... If you think of anything else, please fire an issue or a PR to
  add it here in this readme.
